    <p><font color=red>How to summon Satan</p>
    <p><font color=white>There are myriad ways to get Satan on the line, the easiest of which is probably the Invocation of Satan, a simple chant. You should perform the Invocation in as occult and magical a manner as possible, to increase its efficacy through ambiance. Put on your black robe, draw a salt circle, light some black candles. </p>

    <p><font color=red>Best differents demons to summon</p>
    <p><font color=white>People want to act like summoning demons is a bad thing. I mean, sure, there’s a chance that one of these dukes of the underworld might roll up on you, cast you into darkness and misery, and then subject you to his unending, hellish thrall. But you also might get hit by a bus walking the street, am I right? Plus: remember Solomon? Biblical King of Israel, son of David and wisest dude in the history of always? That dude summoned demons like it was going out of style, and even used them to build his temple. Summoning up demons can’t be all that bad then, right? <strong>read more</strong> </p>

    <p><font color=red>The Anti Christ</p>
    <p><font color=white>Antichrist, the polar opposite and ultimate enemy of Christ. According to Christian tradition, he will reign terribly in the period prior to the Last Judgment. The Antichrist first appeared in the epistles of St. John (I John 2:18, 22; I John 4:3; II John 1:7), and the fully developed story of Antichrist’s life and reign is found in medieval texts. As applied to various individuals and institutions for nearly two millennia, Antichrist and precursor of Antichrist have been, and remain, terms of the most intense opprobrium. </p>
