    <p><font color=orange>Satanic Christianity: Can a Christian Really Be a Satanist?</p>
    <p><font color=white>In the summer of 2009 the Spirit of God spoke to me and said, "Do you know that most of the people who say that they serve in the Kingdom of Heaven aren't truly in the Kingdom? They are Satanic Christians" This was bit of a paradox. I was attempting to rationalize such an awkward statement of how someone could be a "Satanic Christian." The Spirit spoke again and said that everyone who says "Lord, Lord" is not in the Kingdom because they are workers of iniquity. That makes them satanic and not holy. Let us examine the difference between a true Christian and a Satanic one.

What then is definition of a Christian then? It would be made up of five things displayed in a Christian's lifestyle:

1. Professing belief in Jesus as Christ or following the religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus.
2. Relating to or derived from Jesus or Jesus's teachings.
3. Manifesting the qualities or spirit of Jesus; Christlike.
4. Relating to or characteristic of Christianity or its adherents.
5. Showing love and concern for others.

How can someone say that they are a Christian and not keep His commandments? Jesus said in John 14:15, "If ye love me, keep my commandments." Well, you hear some Christians say that they believe in God, they're not perfect, and have issues (habitual sin habits). So what? God knows my heart! You always hear this from cliche from pseudo-Christians. "But they believe in God!" you exclaim. Isn't that what truly matters in the end? The Word says, "Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble."

Actually, all of that was a joke :) have a good day workshiping god!
